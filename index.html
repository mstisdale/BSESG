                <p>Started in 2022, we are a diverse community of black software engineers at the junior, mid, and senior level who have come together to form a support network for fellow black software
                professionals. We have diverse educational backgrounds (bootcamps, self-taught and tradition college degrees) and are located all around the world. We are a place to link up, connect,
            and feel at home. </p>

                <p>Black graduates are 9% of yearly awarded computer science degrees but only 3% of the personnel at top tech companies.
                    We aim to change that. Reach your team goals, hire diverse talent, and gain new and unique perspectives to imform your product all-in-one. Work with us!
